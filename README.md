# DogsAPI
Full Stack exercise

This is an exercise for writing a responsive web app using Angular 5 and Spring Boot web application frameworks.
I might pretty it up some in the future.

When run, the app presents an input box and a list of dog breeds. Enter text in the search box and hit enter/click Apply and the list will be narrowed. If you delete the filter text and hit enter/click Apply the list will be un-narrowed.

At any point, you can click on a dog in the list. If you click a dog with sub-breeds, they will be displayed. If you click a dog without sub-breeds or on a sub-breed, a picture of that breed/sub-breed will appear.
